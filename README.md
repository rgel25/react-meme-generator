## Welcome! üëã

React Meme Generator is a simple React app that pulls popular meme images from an API and adds context to the image.

## The challenge

The challenges here is to make a succesful API call to ("https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes"), display a random image and give users ability to add top and bottom texts as a context to the image and also pull a different image from the API call as the user clicks on the main button.

## My solution

- API Call - used React side effect to fetch data using an async function
  - ![solution for API call](https://i.ibb.co/8BLMsdL/useeffect.png)
- State - used React state to manage data of meme and allMeme data (JSON)
